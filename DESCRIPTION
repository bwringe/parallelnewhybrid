Description: This function takes advantage of the parallel processing ability
    inherent in multicore computers to distribute iterations of NewHybrids analyses
    across the available cores, and repopulate the cores with new analyses as the
    tasks complete. Also included in this package is the ability to rapidly create
    simulated multi-generational hybrid datasets (Pure1, Pure2, F1, F2, BC1, BC2;
    Anderson XXXX) to test the accuracy of NewHybrids assignments.
