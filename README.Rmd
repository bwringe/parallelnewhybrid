### ***parallelnewhybrid*** is an R package designed to parallelize *NewHybrids* analyses


***  

###Package Installation
**parallelenewhybrid** can be installed from GitHub using the R package *devtools* and the function *install_github*:  
```
devtools::install_github("bwringe/parallelnewhybrid")
```
<span style = "color:red"> <strong>NOTE:</strong></span> : **parallelnewhybrid** relies on functions from the R packages *parallel*, *plyr*, *stringr*, and *tidyr*. The user should ensure these are installed from CRAN prior to installing **parallelnh**.  

***  

###Function descriptions
<h4 class="text-primary">parallelnh_xx.R</h4>
Allows *NewHybrids* (Anderson and Thompson 2002) to be run in parallel. A job (*NewHybrids* analysis) is assigned to each of the *c* cores available in the computer. As each task finishes, a new analysis is asigned to the idled core.  
All *NewHybrids* format files in the folder the user specifies as *folder.data* will be analyzed.  
The user can also specify the length of the MCMC burnin using the *burnin* and *sweeps* parameters.  
<span style = "color:red"> <strong>NOTE:</strong></span> : There are **three operating system-specific versions** of the **parallelnh_xx** function because of the different ways in which the operating systems handle forking of processes.  

**parallelnh version**|**Operating system**
------------|----------
**parallelnh_OSX** | OS X
**parallelnh_WIN** | Windows
**parallelnh_LINUX** | Linux (Ubuntu)

###How to use:  
####Example datasets:  
Example datasets have been provided as R images (.rda files). These can be loaded into your workspace using the ``data()`` function  

**Example dataset** | **Contents**  
------------|---------------------------------------------------------------  
*PurePops* | A *GENEPOP* format file containing the genotypes at 240 SNP loci for 60 individuals in each of two ancestral populations (PopA and PopB). This is the data format for **freqbasedsim**, and as such the file can be entered into this function directly.  
*SimPops\_S1R1_NH* | A *NewHybrids* format file. This file is the result of running **freqbasedsim** using the default parameters on the *PurePops* dataset. *SimPops\_S1R1_NH* can be analyzed using the function **parallelnh_xx**.  

***  
<h4 class="text-primary">parallelnh_xx</h4>  

**Parameter** | **Description**
------------|---------------------------------------------------------------  
*folder.data*| A file path to the folder in which the *NewHybrids* formatted files to be analyzed reside.   
*where.NH* | A file path to the *NewHybrids* installation folder
*burnin* | An integer specifying how many burnin steps *NewHybrids* is to run
*sweeps* | An integer specifying how many sweep steps *NewHybrids* is to run  

```r
### Run analyses on all NewHybrids format files in the folder "your_data_to_analyze"
parallelnh_OSX(folder.data = "~/ ... /your_data_to_analyze/", where.NH = "~/ ... /newhybrids/", burnin = 5000, sweeps = 10000)
## the usage would be the same for the WIN and LINUX versions.
```
