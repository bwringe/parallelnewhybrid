\usage{
freqbasedsim_Advanced(GenePopData, pop.groups = c("PopA", "PopB"),
  outputName = NULL, NumSims = 1, NumReps = 1, prop.sample = 0.9,
  sample.sizePure1 = NULL, sample.sizePure2 = NULL, sample.sizeF1 = NULL,
  sample.sizeF2 = NULL, sample.sizeBC1 = NULL, sample.sizeBC2 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{GenePopData}{file path to a GenePop formatted file containing genotypes from two (2) ancestral populations. This is the data from which the simulated hybrids will be constructed}

\item{pop.groups}{Optional character vector denoting how the two ancestral populations should be named; default is PopA and PopB}

\item{outputName}{an optioanal character vector to be applied as the name of the output. The default is NULL, in which case the output name is constructed from the name of the input, with the suffix _SiRj_NH added where i is the number of simulations corresponding to the output, and j is the number of replicates of the ith simulation. NH refers to the fact that the output is in NewHybrids format}

\item{NumSims}{an integer number of simulated datasets to be created; default is 1}

\item{NumReps}{an integer number of replicates to be created for each of the n simulated datasets specified
in NumSims; default is 1}

\item{sample.sizeF1}{an integer number of simulated F1 individuals to be created; default is 200}

\item{sample.sizeF2}{an integer number of simulated F1 individuals to be created; default is 200}

\item{sample.sizePure}{an integer number of simulated Pure1 and Pure2 (centred ancestral populations) individuals to be created; default is 200}

\item{sample.sizeBC}{an integer number of simulated Backross1 and Backcross2 (F1 X each of the Pure1 and Pure2) individuals to be created; default is 200}
}
\description{
\code{freqbasedsim_Advanced} generates simulated, centred Pure1, Pure2, F1, F2, BC1 and BC2 offspring based on the genotype frequencies of two ancestral populations provided. The advanced version also allows the user to specify the number of individuals of each category to be simulated (including zero individuals should the user not wish to simulate a category).
